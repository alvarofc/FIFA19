If you had to look for the data files he used, would you be able to do it easily?
Yes

Does the repository include a .gitignore file?
Yes

Is it easy for you to know what part of the analysis each file contains?

Read one of those code files. Does it have a clear purpose? (e.g: scraping a web, cleaning the data, …)
